    "# 🧪 User Acceptance Test (UAT) for Feast Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a full end-to-end User Acceptance Test (UAT) for a Feast setup using PostgreSQL for both the offline and online stores, and SQL-based registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Steps Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Feast Configuration**  \n",
    "   Copies the `feature_store.yaml` file from the location specified by the `FEAST_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable into the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Sample Data into Offline Store**  \n",
    "   Reads `data/driver_stats.parquet` and loads it into the configured PostgreSQL offline store using credentials extracted from `feature_store.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Feature Definitions**  \n",
    "   Cleans up the `specs/` directory, ensures it is a valid Python package, and uses the `FeatureStore.apply()` method to register entities, features, and data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Historical Features**  \n",
    "   Fetches historical training data using `get_historical_features()` to ensure offline retrieval logic is functioning as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Materialize Features to Online Store**  \n",
    "   Uses `materialize()` or `materialize_incremental()` to populate the online store from the offline store, testing the materialization path.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Retrieve Online Features**  \n",
    "   Uses `get_online_features()` to ensure real-time retrieval from the online store works correctly with previously materialized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook verifies that Feast is correctly configured, the stores are accessible and populated, and that both offline and online retrieval workflows function end-to-end."
