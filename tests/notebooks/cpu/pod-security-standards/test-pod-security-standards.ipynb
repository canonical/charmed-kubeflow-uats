    "# User Acceptance Test (UAT) for Pod Security Standards\n",
    "This notebook verififes that the Kubernetes **Pod Security Standards (PSS)** are being correctly enforced on the current namespace. The test attempts to deploy a Pod (`privileged_pod.yaml`) that **violates** the `Restricted` and `Baseline` PSS profiles (e.g., by requesting privileged mode).\n",
